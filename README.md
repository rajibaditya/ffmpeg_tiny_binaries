# ffmpeg_tiny_binaries
An educational repository providing small ffmpeg binaries
# This is an educational project
It provides small static ffmpeg binaries. That means binaries without many external libraries compiled.
Why?
1. Because it was the result of my trying to learn to compile static ffmpeg binaries for linux and Windows.
2. Because someone may need the smaller binaries because they have no need for the full monty.

If you need full binaries which are robust, up to date, and tested, look elsewhere.
Here are a few links to point you in that direction:
Windows:
