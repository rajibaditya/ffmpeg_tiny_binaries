# ffmpeg_tiny_binaries
An educational repository providing small ffmpeg binaries
# This is an educational project
It provides small static ffmpeg binaries. That means binaries without many external libraries compiled.
Why?<br>
1. Because it was the result of my trying to learn to compile static ffmpeg binaries for linux and Windows.<br>
2. Because someone may need the smaller binaries because they have no need for the full monty.<br>

If you need full binaries which are robust, up to date, and tested, look elsewhere.<br>
Here are a few links to point you in that direction:<br>
